  <h1>Introduction</h1>
  <p>Liver disease averts the normal function of the liver mainly due to the large amount of the alcohol consumption liver disease arises early prediction of the liver disease using classification Algorithm in an efficacious task that can help the doctors to diagnostics the disease within a short duration of the time. Discovering the existence of liver disease at an early stage is a complex task for the doctor. The main objective of this paper is to analyse the parameters of various classification Algorithm and compare their predictive accuracies so as to find out the best classifier for determining the liver disease the paper focuses on the related works of various others on liver disease such that algorithms were implemented using Weka tools that is a machine learning software return in java various attributes that are essential in the prediction of liver disease were examined and the dataset of liver patients were also evaluated. This paper compares various classification algorithms such as Random Forest, Logistic Regression and Separation Algorithm with an aim to identify the best tecchbique. Based on this study, Random Forest with the highest accuracy outperformed the other alogrithms and can be further utilised in the prediction of liver diseaserecommended. </p>
